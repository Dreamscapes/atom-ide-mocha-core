# Atom-IDE-Mocha

> Integrate your Mocha test suite's progress with Atom using Atom-IDE-UI components üé®

## About

This repository holds two major components:

- [mocha-reporter-remote][reporter-home] - A Mocha reporter which sends progress events over a Unix socket or a plain TCP connection
- [ide-mocha][ui-home] - The Atom package which reads the Mocha progress reports and feeds them into various Atom-IDE-UI components

> See the individual packages' README files for more details.

The main Atom package repo can be [found here][ide-mocha-repo].

## Examples

The gif is in terrible quality, but it does show everything - from starting the test suite independently of Atom to seeing progress reports as well as diagnostics messages.

## About

This package contains code for IDE-Mocha Atom package. It is separated because Atom's package architecture does not support compiling code on publish time. 🤷‍♂️ So we publish from here to npm first and then use the published package as a dependency in the main Atom package's repository.

Atom package repository: [IDE-mocha][ide-mocha-repo]
